<h1>Readme</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
This folder and the documents within specifies the coding standards and conventiona I use for work in personal projects, or projects that have no specified coding standards at the time I work on them.

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li> Throughout the documents in this folder, the term "standards" is used to encompass both standards and conventions. While this means some semantic errors occur, it saves me typing "conventions" too often.</l1>
